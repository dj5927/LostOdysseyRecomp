# Card D 3C6T city measurement — published v0.5.11 — 2026-09-14

This record is a process-level 3-physical-core / 6-hardware-thread envelope on the **same published v0.5.11** package as [Card A](cpu-card-a-city-2026-09-14.md). It does **not** implement host pinning, does not change `KeSetAffinityThread`, does not authorize a version bump, whole-game acceptance, Steam Deck validation, or a new GitHub Release. UnleashedRecomp's affinity stub is the same no-pin baseline; do not treat that project as a pinning recipe.

The measured binary is the published Windows package, not a `cpu-perf` RelWithDebInfo rebuild and not the installed v0.5.13 player executable. Player `settings.ini` hash remained `f41265ad611d2241cc5522f18ea1908156045856b43856730797e62849d9d8a1`. `original_saves_changed=false` and `player_saves_changed=false`.

Observed affinity after `Start-Process` was `0x3F` / logical `[0,1,2,3,4,5]`. Topology on this machine is 8 SMT pairs, all `eclass=0`, single CCD.

## City window

City frames are `draws >= 800`. Classifier `over_budget` was 0%. `phase_end=done`, elapsed 274.1 s. Isolated `run/save` and the player save tree were both unchanged.

| Count | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| City frames | 1370 |
| Mean draws | 953.0 |
| Menu frames | 891 |
| Last swap / last draws | 1380 / 824 |

Fewer city frames than Card A (1836) because this isolated run had **no startup bundle**: metadata snapshot 3 ms, then `startup bundle fallback: bundle missing`. Shader preparation reported **16 logical threads, 15 requested workers** for 28,484 shaders (`std::thread::hardware_concurrency()` is the machine width, not the affinity mask). Bundle publish landed at 215.360 s (28,484 records). Pipeline preparation was 0 recipes / 0 ms. That cold-prepare oversubscription is a boot observation, not a per-frame city fence.

Video: D3D12, RTX 5080, swapchain 1280×720, `gpu_slots=2`, descriptor limit 1800.

## Card A metrics on the 3C6T envelope (city frames only)

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `fence_wait_ms` | 0.0008 | — | 0.1336 | 0.0007 / 0.1371; 0 frames >1 ms both |

City `vertex_ms` 0.376, `bind_ms` 0.784, `record_ms` 1.339, `shader_lookup_ms` 0.052, `pipeline_lookup_ms` 0.031.

## UnleashedRecomp reference (not copied)

[UnleashedRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp) `KeSetAffinityThread` is the same stub (`*lpPreviousAffinity = 2; return 0`). There is no `SetThreadAffinityMask` / `SetProcessAffinityMask` / `pthread_setaffinity`. Steam Deck notes there are Linux + Gamescope GPU-clock guidance, not Xenon 6T pinning. Their renderer is D3D9 HLE, not a Xenos ring; that path is not portable to this UE3/PM4 host.

## Verdict

`exhausted_resource_class = null`. **implement = false** for default host pinning and for writing placement into `KeSetAffinityThread`.

On this published-v0.5.11 city protocol with process affinity `0x3F`:

- Per-frame fence / split / GPU queue stay in the same class as unconstrained Card A.
- `draw_ms` mean rose 3.44 → 3.81 ms; p95 4.56 ms; max 13.65 ms still under 16.67 ms.
- Cold shader prepare requested 15 workers on a 6-thread mask because `hardware_concurrency` ignores process affinity. Do not treat that boot oversubscription as a reason to add another prepare pool (Card C already `implement=false`).
- This host is still a 9800X3D plus RTX 5080. **It is not Steam Deck, not 15 W, not 4C8T Zen2+RDNA2, not 1080p60@15W.**

Keep `KeSetAffinityThread` as a guest-visible stub. Keep topology-aware pinning experimental and default off. Low-spec 60 FPS work stays in quality budget, GPU submit path, and native Linux/Vulkan — not Card D pinning.

This is one Hidden 1280×720 D3D12 city window under a desktop 3C6T process mask. It is not 4K, Vulkan, Deck, whole-game, or player acceptance evidence.
